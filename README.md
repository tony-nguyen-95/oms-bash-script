### Summary Explanation:

1. **Grant Permissions**:

   - `chmod -R 777 .`: This command ensures that all files and directories in the current working directory have full permissions (read, write, and execute) for all users. This is necessary to ensure that all scripts can be executed without permission issues.

2. **Running Exercise Scripts**:

   - `./ex1.sh`: Executes the first exercise script.
   - `./ex2.sh`: Executes the second exercise script.
   - `./ex3.sh`: Executes the third exercise script. Note that there are no directories with 80% free space left.
   - `./ex4.sh note.txt`: Executes the fourth exercise script with `note.txt` as an argument.
   - `./ex5.sh`: Executes the fifth exercise script.

3. **Images for Results**:
   - The results of running each exercise script are shown in the images `images/image-1.png` to `images/image-5.png`.

This `README.md` file provides clear instructions for setting up permissions, running the exercise scripts, and viewing the results, making it easy for anyone to follow along.
